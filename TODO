The goal is to have a "generic" .bashrc file which calls other
dotfiles.  The dotfiles repo should be ~/.dotfiles or something similar but
hidden.

An install script symlinks the dotfiles to their proper place.
This makes it simple when updating dotfiles - a simple 'git pull' in the
dotfiles repo directory is all that's needed.


System dot-files, OS agnostic (hopefully)

.bashrc              - Bash runtime configuration
.bash_profile        - Bash profile
.vimrc               - VIM runtime configuarion
.git-completion.sh   - Completion for Git repos
.git-prompt.sh       - Git-aware prompt
.gitconfig           - Global Git config
.gitflow_export      - Global Git Flow
.gitignore_global    - Global Git ignore

Future - Split .bashrc into different files:
bash_functions       - User defined functions - maybe one file for each OS
                       or have one section for OS-related stuff.
bash_aliases         - User-defined aliases - same as above
bash_environment     - Bash environment variables
bash_colors          - Terminal text colorizations
